COVID-19 Italia

An application to track COVID-19 data for Italy and all regions, with stats and graphs to show some interesting data of the disease that it's spreading in the country.
It is available in English and Italian, supports system's theme (dark or light) and has some information about how to help Italy's finances by donating money.
A big thanks to Protezione Civile and Davide Magno for data.
